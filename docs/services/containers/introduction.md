## What is it?
Container as a service (CaaS) is a cloud service model that allows users to upload, organize, run, scale, manage and stop containers by using a provider's API calls or a web portal interface. Container as a service allows IT staff to deploy container-based virtual applications without installing the underlying software stack.

## Why do we need it?
Containers are a solution to the problem of how to get software to run reliably when moved from one computing environment to another. This could be from a developer's laptop to a test environment, from a staging environment into production, and perhaps from a physical machine in a data center to a virtual machine in a private or public cloud.
