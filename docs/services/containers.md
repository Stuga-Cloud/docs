## Container as a service
Container as a service (CaaS) is a cloud service model that allows users to upload, organize, run, scale, manage and stop containers by using a provider's API calls or a web portal interface. Container as a service allows IT staff to deploy container-based virtual applications without installing the underlying software stack.
